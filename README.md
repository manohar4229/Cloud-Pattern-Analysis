# Cloud Pattern Analysis

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** for detecting and segmenting cloud patterns in images. The application uses a deep learning model (UNet++) to identify and segment four classes of cloud patterns: **Fish**, **Flower**, **Gravel**, and **Sugar**. It provides an interactive interface for uploading images, configuring thresholds, and visualizing predictions with bounding boxes.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload up to 10 images in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format.
- **Cloud Pattern Detection**: Detect and segment cloud patterns into four classes: Fish, Flower, Gravel, and Sugar.
- **Threshold Configuration**: Adjust label and pixel thresholds for each class via the sidebar.
- **Visualization**: View predictions with bounding boxes and semi-transparent masks overlaid on the original images.
- **Download Results**: Export predictions as a CSV file in RLE (Run-Length Encoding) format.

## Requirements

The application requires the following Python libraries:

- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `cv2` (OpenCV)
- `matplotlib`
- `streamlit`
- `Pillow`
- `segmentation-models-pytorch`
- `tqdm`

Install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## File Structure

- **`app.py`**: The main application file containing the Streamlit app, model definition, helper functions, and visualization logic.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1. **Upload Images**: Use the file uploader to upload up to 10 images.
2. **Configure Settings**:
   - Select the model checkpoint file from the sidebar.
   - Adjust label and pixel thresholds for each class.
   - Enable or disable visualization.
3. **View Results**:
   - The app displays a table of predictions in RLE format.
   - Download the results as a CSV file.
4. **Visualize Predictions**:
   - View bounding boxes and masks overlaid on the original images.

## Model Details

The application uses a **UNet++** model from the `segmentation-models-pytorch` library. The model is pre-trained with the `timm-efficientnet-b4` encoder and fine-tuned for segmenting cloud patterns.

### Model Loading

The model is loaded from a checkpoint file (`.pth`) selected via the sidebar. Ensure the checkpoint file is present in the project directory.

## Helper Functions

- **`mask2rle(mask)`**: Converts a binary mask to RLE format.
- **`rle2mask(rle_string, height, width)`**: Converts an RLE string back to a binary mask.
- **`resize_image(image, target_shape)`**: Resizes an image to the specified dimensions.
- **`get_bounding_box(binary_mask)`**: Calculates bounding box coordinates for a binary mask.
- **`predict_uploaded_images(uploaded_files, model, label_thresholds, pixel_thresholds)`**: Processes uploaded images and generates predictions.
- **`create_visualization(viz_data, selected_classes)`**: Creates visualizations with bounding boxes and masks.

## Advanced Settings

- **Label Thresholds**: Adjust the confidence threshold for each class to determine whether a label is assigned.
- **Pixel Thresholds**: Adjust the pixel-level threshold for each class to refine segmentation masks.

## Example Output

- **Prediction Table**: A table with `Image_Label` and `EncodedPixels` columns.
- **Visualization**: Images with bounding boxes and masks overlaid.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the model checkpoint file exists in the project directory.
- Verify that uploaded images are in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format.
- Check the console or Streamlit error messages for detailed debugging information.
